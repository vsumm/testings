"    <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3> <p>For uniform representation of fonts, this "

"loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and "
"fonts correctly.</p> <p>For this purpose your browser has to establish a "
"direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web "
"page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done "
"in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our plugin. This "
"constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p> <p>If "
"your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your "
